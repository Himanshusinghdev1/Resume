    <h2>Profile Info</h2>
    <p>As a B.Tech. 2nd year student, I'm weaving intricate webs of code with C, HTML, CSS and
        Python. My playground? The dynamic world of Internet of Things, where I've brought smart
        kitchens to life which was my project. Curious about the future of machines? My journey into
        machine learning has just begun, and I'm eager to share my explorations.
